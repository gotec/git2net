While this is uneccessary for small repositories such as `git2net` this might become higly relevant for larger projects such as `linux`, where individual commits can make changes to thousands of files which in turn require significant computational resources to analyse. This is particularly important for merge commits, as all files included in the diffs to both parent commits need to be considered.
